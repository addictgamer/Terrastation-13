<h1>Welcome to Terrastation 13!</h1>

<i>This server is running a Terrastation 13 dev build. There will be bugs and broken features.</i><br>
Make sure to view the server's rules before you start playing.<br>

This is a roleplaying server, so don't forget to remain in character while playing and no IC-in-OOC and vice versa. Make sure to read and abide by the rules and if you have any questions, feel free to adminhelp! Remember that even when there are no admins on, adminhelps are being sent to IRC and it is possible for an administrator to see it and respond. If you don't roleplay properly like a bloody twit, you will get banned without mercy.
