<body>There are a few notable rules we have here. If you disagree with them, drop by the terraform gaming forums, head over into the space station 13 subforum (found in index of games->computer), and drop a blarg in this server's topic. We might listen to you. <br />
	<br />
	
	<ol>
		<li>Don't be a dick. This is subject to interpretation, and there is a gray area, but for the most part it should be obvious if you're breaking it or not.</li>
		<li>Murder is a touchy thing. On the one hand, it sucks being knocked out of the round for a couple of hours. On the other, it's SS13. It's hard to articulate every circumstance that killing a guy is and isn't acceptable, so I'll just try and convey the general philosophy and hope you can extrapolate from that<br />
			</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Self defense is always acceptable. Sometimes calling Security isn't enough, and that asshole trying to strangle you for your slightly higher access ID won't fuck off. Just don't confuse an instance of outright paranoia with one of obvious imminent danger.</li>
			<li>Syndicate are dangerous! Syndicate are notorious criminals, renowned for their proclivity of raiding and destroying stations not unlike space vikings. Murdering an innocent and claiming he is a Syndicate is actually worse than being a Syndicate yourself, and will not only bring you retribution from the crew, but the gods as well.</li>
			<li>"I'm crazy!!!1" is shitty roleplaying tossed up to thinly veil the fact that you want to grief the station and not get punished for it.</li>
			<li>generally it's usually better to brig someone than kill them, but circumstances are not always ideal, and the safety of the crew comes before the safety of the proven traitor when all is said and done.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Security has a tendency to ruin the round for everyone else. You have greater expectations placed on you than other positions. If you cannot handle that responsibility, ask for a job change. Someone with a position of authority like Security, Captain, HoP, etc. will receive harsher punishments for offenses than those not in such a position. Yes, this is unfair. Deal with it or take off the shades.<br />
			</li>
		<li>Keep IC out of OOC. At worst it ruins game modes by blowing traitors' covers and at best it pisses off everybody and stirs up drama. If you need help, admin help it. Many questions break the IC over OOC rule. If it doesn't spoil what's happening ingame, and adminhelp got you no response after waiting a decent ammount of time, then OOC it. Otherwise, ask again after a decent ammount of time passes. Or post in the forums. We don't always have an admin online. That's how life is.</li>
		<li>Don't metagame. The big one here is calling the shuttle immediately at the beginning of the round to test the gamemode in Secret. It is bullshit and will get you on everyone's bad side very quickly.<br />
			</li>
	</ol><br />
	We try and play it straight here. We don't like to metagame. We like to roleplay. We like to enjoy each other's company. We don't like to piss each other off.<br />
	<br />
	The way we play the game isn't everyone's cup of tea. We understand that and we don't fault you if you enjoy a different style of play, but we do expect you to go elsewhere for that.<br />
	<br />
	This is not a comprehensive list. You're using my server and my bandwidth, and as Draconian as it sounds I have the final say on who stays and who goes. <br />
