OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Hello
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : New player? I suggest you take a glance at the rules.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Would you mind if I asked you a quick question or two about servers?
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Er, go ahead.
SAY: Dragon Toast/LordZakida : How much metal do you need?
SAY: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : A whole stack.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Alright, this may seem like a really easy one, but the lack of people in the SS13 community makes it hard to get answers
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : How did you change the name of your server? XD
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Hmm...
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : You mean the name that appears in teh BYOND hub or the actual server name? Those are not the same. At least not in the Terrastation code.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Like, to Terrastation 13 on the main page
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Ok.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : The BYOND hub shows the name of the station, not the server.
SAY: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Yes, the byond hub.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Yes, the byond hub.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : So you have to go into code/procs/station_name.dm
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : That, and the server name too. That would also be useful. :P
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : The server name is...Set in the config I think.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : The code references the config in regards to the server name, anyway.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : It&#39;s also found in hub.dmi, which is iforgetwhere
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : You can search the code for it.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : I&#39;m using the most recent version of BayStation12
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Which is the most recently updated, imo.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Hmm. I&#39;ve not taken a deep look at it.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : It&#39;s really nice.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : I know
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : I borrowed some of their bug fixes and features.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : However, I am running a two year old tgs svn checkout.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Or one year old, don&#39;t remember how long ago I checked it out.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : You can hit ctrl+f in dream maker, and search for station_name
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Ah, I found something.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Then you can change what it&#39;s being set to, everywhere it&#39;s being set, to what you desire toname your station
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : var/game_version = &#34;Baystation 12&#34;
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : That probably doesn&#39;t do anything.

OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : var/station_name = null
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : You can do a search through the files (and by that, I mean ctrl+f), to find references to it

OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : That&#39;s the default.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Correct
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : My server name comes up as &#34;NSS Exodus&#34;
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : I always wondered what makes it set that as the default.

OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : I don&#39;t know what world name does.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : I changed mine to Terrastation 13 just in case.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : I&#39;m thinking it might be the application title.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Such as, the name in the top left of the game window.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Perhaps.
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Much thanks, but I&#39;ve got one more question. :P
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : Is there any way to change the hoster name?

OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : It worked.
OOC: Hootis Blargenkins/Addictgamer : Wait, it&#39;s not there
OOC: Rickena Jones/LoneTehWolf : My guess is that I need quotes, due to me using two words as my hoster.
